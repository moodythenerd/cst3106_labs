# üé≤ Yatzy ‚Äì Lab 05: Styling and UI Design

## üß† Overview
This project is a front-end web version of the classic dice game **Yatzy**.  
The goal of this lab is to design a **modern, responsive interface** using HTML and CSS ‚Äî focusing purely on styling, accessibility, and layout, without implementing the full game logic yet.

The interface will represent the core parts of the Yatzy game:
- Rolling and holding dice
- Viewing the score categories
- Showing the current turn and roll count

This version uses a **Tech Minimalist** design style with dark backgrounds, glassmorphism, and glowing violet accents.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Build a structured and semantic Yatzy layout using HTML5.
- Apply advanced CSS styling techniques (glass panels, shadows, hover animations).
- Use a consistent **Cyber Violet** color palette.
- Maintain accessibility and responsive design principles.
- Prepare the base for future JavaScript logic (rolls, holds, scoring updates).

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **CSS** for design, layout, and animation
- **WebStorm** as the main development environment
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and branch management

---

## üé® Design Theme: Tech Minimalist (Cyber Violet)
- Dark glass backgrounds with subtle transparency
- Bright violet glows for accents and focus rings
- Smooth hover animations and dice roll spins
- Rounded corners and soft shadows to keep it clean and futuristic

---

## üì∏ Planned Features
- Dice tray with glowing interactive dice
- Buttons for Roll and Reset
- Scorecard with organized categories and hover states
- Keyboard accessibility for focus/hold actions
- Light motion effects that respect reduced motion settings

---

## üß© Future Expansion
This lab focuses on static design, but the next steps could include:
- Adding JavaScript for real dice rolls
- Toggling dice hold states dynamically
- Updating the score automatically
- Saving high scores locally

1. Roll five dice.
2. Choose which dice to **hold** and which to **reroll**.
3. You can roll up to **three times** per turn.
4. After your final roll, select a **scoring category** to record your result.
5. Each category can only be used once.
6. After all categories are filled, the game ends ‚Äî the player with the **highest total score** wins.
